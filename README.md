Shaping Australian Stories: Compare, share and connect.
Empowering Australians to form an understanding of how they compare to others in their demographic, connect to relevant services and share their story.
In an age of social media, it seems as if everyone is kicking goals and it can sometimes feel as if you are falling behind but social media is subjective, how do we truly understand where we fit in our demographic?
Introducing Izzy…
Simply by asking our-chat bot “Izzy” questions about your health, wealth and lifestyle, you can gauge an understanding of how you compare and how you can better your circumstances. Izzy can refer you to the relevant Government departments that may be able to provide you support if you need it. Izzy can help also you set health goals. When your done chatting to Izzy, you can share your story that will be published anonymously on the website that will breathe life into the numbers.
